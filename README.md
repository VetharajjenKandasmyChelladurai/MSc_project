#A Dietary Assistance Model for T2DM Patients Using Transformers

## Overview

This project is focused on developing a dietary recommendation system for individuals with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). By integrating various datasets related to recipes, nutritional information, and diabetic self-care data, the system utilizes a deep learning model to provide personalized dietary recommendations. The goal is to help T2DM patients maintain optimal glycemic control through tailored nutritional advice.

## Features

- **Personalized Dietary Recommendations**: Provides meal suggestions based on individual health data, including glucose levels, BMI, and dietary preferences.
- **Deep Learning Model**: Implements a transformer-based deep learning model to analyze and predict the impact of different foods on blood glucose levels.
- **Data Integration**: Combines data from multiple sources, including recipe datasets, nutrient databases, and self-care logs, to generate comprehensive recommendations.
